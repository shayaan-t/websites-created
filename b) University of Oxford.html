            <p>The University of Oxford is a collegiate research university in Oxford, England. There is evidence of teaching as early as 1096, making it the oldest university in the English-speaking world and the world's second-oldest university in continuous operation</p>
            <p>The most obvious reason for Oxford's fame is the university. It's the second oldest in the world (allegedly), educator of 28 Nobel Prize winners, and often cited as the best university on the planet. ... And after Cambridge, no other universities were founded in England until 1832.</p>
